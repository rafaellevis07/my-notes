================================================ Promises */

/*

Promise in javascript is a class that can be invoked that
takes a function which can have two arguments to it, resolve and reject, 
and inside of the function we write the logic that will define the promise.
(most of times we will be dealing with promises that are returned and we wont be creating them as much.)


Resolve is a function that we call when we want success to happen (condition is true)
Reject is a function that is called when there is failure (condition is false)

*/

const event = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  var name = "John";
  if (name == "Rafael") {
    resolve(name);
  } else {
    reject("Name didn't match! Try again.");
  }
});


/* 
.then() is called if we're resolve and .catch() is called if we're reject
We can put logic inside of the methods called.
*/


event
  .then((name) => {
    console.log(name);
  })
  .catch((err) => {
    console.log(err);
  })
  .finally(() => {
    console.log("PROMISE FINISHED");
  });
