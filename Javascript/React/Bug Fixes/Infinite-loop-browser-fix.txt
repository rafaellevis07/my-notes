===================================================================================== Fix


Infinite loop in a React component

You can stop infinite loops in chrome without force-closing the program in two ways:

One: Dev Tools

1. Dev tools (if not already open, go View -> Developer -> Developer Tools)
2. Sources tab
3. Press the Pause icon "⏸" near the top right of the Sources panel


Use method two if you can’t open dev tools.

1. Press the three vertical dots in the top right corner of Chrome
2. Hover over “More tools...” near the mid-bottom
3. Press “Task Manager”
4. Select the tab you are experiencing the loop in
5. Hit “End Process”
