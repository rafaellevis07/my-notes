XSS (Cross-Site-Scripting)

<!-- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks are a type of injection, in which malicious scripts are injected 
     into otherwise benign and trusted websites. -->

    - A hacker posts a comment to a blog with some embedded javascript.

    - The user then logs in, opens the page that has the comment with embedded javascript

    - the javascript code is executed! potentially stealing a cookie, or some other information

        Solution: Sanitize user input, escape javascript



==================================================================================================


CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)

    <!-- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is an attack that forces an end user to execute unwanted actions on 
         a web application in which theyâ€™re currently authenticated. -->

    - While the user is signed in, a hacker can send an email with a malicious link

    - If the user clicks that link, the request is sent to the server, 
      and treated as if the user himself sent it.

    - So the hacker bypasses the login page.

        Solution: Create an authenticity_token and place it in a hidden field in the form, 
        so the server can know it came from the user, and not the hacker

SQL Injection

    <-- SQL injection, also known as SQLI, is a common attack vector that uses malicious SQL code for 
        backend database manipulation to access information that was not intended to be displayed. -->

    - A Hacker types in SQL code to delete a tabel, or to make himself an admin...

    - If the server does not sanitize the user input, the SQL typed by the hacker will run.

        Solution: Sanitize user input, escape SQL
