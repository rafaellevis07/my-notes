//This is perfect for development environment. For production we should use mailers (gmail/amazon)


# Rails Setup
# First add the gem to your development environment and run the bundle command to install it.
gem "letter_opener", group: :development

# Then run
$bundle


# Then set the delivery method in config/environments/development.rb

config.action_mailer.default_url_options = { host: 'localhost', port: 3000 } # This one is already on file
config.action_mailer.delivery_method = :letter_opener
config.action_mailer.perform_deliveries = true
