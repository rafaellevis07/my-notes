# The 'as' is used to name a route so it can be used easily. Also it is not a must in a route.

// Add all CRUD operations and needed routes

CRUD - Create, Read, Update and Delete operations


# Resource routing allows you to quickly declare all of the common routes for a given resourceful controller.  A single call to resources can declare all of the necessary routes for your index, show, new, edit, create, update, and destroy actions.


Rails.application.routes.draw do
  resources :<controller_name>
  Resources :posts
end


# Or we can declare route per route (Most common routes used)
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  GET	'/photos', to: 'photos#index'	  # display a list of all photos
  GET	'/photos/new', to: 'photos#new'   # return an HTML form for creating a new photo
  POST	'/photos', to: 'photos#create'	  # create a new photo
  GET	'/photos/:id', to: 'photos#show'  # display a specific photo
  GET	'/photos/:id/edit', to: 'photos#edit'	# return an HTML form for editing a photo
  PATCH/PUT '/photos/:id', to: 'photos#update'	# update a specific photo
  DELETE '/photos/:id', to: 'photos#destroy'	# delete a specific photo
end



# If you need to create routes for more than one resource, you can save a bit of typing by defining them all with a single call to resources:

resources :photos, :books, :videos
