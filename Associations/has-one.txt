============================================================================================


# We use a has_one when we want to establish a one on one relationship. (every department has one manager, and the manager manages the specific department)
# It is the same than has_many association, but the model belongs to only one instance to the model defining has_one association


// Initial Set up

$ rails new <app_name>
$ rails g scaffold manager name:string description:text
$ rails g scaffold department title:string manager:references

$ rails db:migrate



====================================================================================== models

// manager.rb

class Manager < ApplicationRecord
    has_one :department                 #singular form
end


department.rb
class Department < ApplicationRecord
    belongs_to :manager                 # singular form
end


===================================================================================== rails c 

manager = Manager.create(name: 'Rafael')
department = Department.create(title: 'Programming Department', manager_id: manager.id)             # Why manager_id?

manager.department               # find manager by department
department.manager               # find department by manager



=================================================================================== views

<p style="color: green"><%= notice %></p>

<%= render @manager %>


<!-- RAFA START -->
  <h5>Department:</h5>
  <ul>
    <%= @manager.department.title %>
  </ul>
<!-- RAFA END -->

  <div>
  <%= link_to "Edit this manager", edit_manager_path(@manager) %> |
  <%= link_to "Back to managers", managers_path %>

  <%= button_to "Destroy this manager", @manager, method: :delete %>
</div>
