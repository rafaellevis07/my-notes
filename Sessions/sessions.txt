// Where to store session data:

    - Cookie
    - Cache
    - Database


# Cookie

    - storing your sessions in cookies is by far the easiest way to go. 
    - It doesn’t need any extra infrastructure or setup.


# Cache
    - Your cache data and sessions could be fighting for space
    - The cache store is the second-easiest place to store session data, since it’s already set up.


# Database

    client: username and passowrd
    server: look it up in the db, if found, create a cookie with userId encrypted, send to client
    client: now has access to cookie, and sends it with every request
    client: on logout, delete cookie

- If you want to keep your session data around until it legitimately expires, 
you probably want to keep it in some kind of database. 

- On login, server creates a session record in the DB, with a randomID, and base64 {userId: 123}, 
on the data field client uses that sessionId on the cookie

- Your cookie only contains a sessionID , the server looks that up in the sessions table in the DB 



# Usually try cookie first, then cache, then database.
