// Redis
	# Sidekiq works closely with Redis 4.0+ to organize job queues and store statistics. 
	# Redis (stands for Remote Dictionary Server) is a fast open source in-memory key-value data store (Database). 
	# It provides sub-millisecond response times and allows real-time applications to run millions of requests per second. 
	# In other words Redis is a database, a key-value store.


# Install redis:
	$brew install redis


# Start redis:
	$redis-server          # Once running, you don't need to start again.

	or

	$ brew services start redis			# Usually use this one

# Stops Redis server:
	$ brew services stop redis

# Restart Redis server:
	$ brew services restart redis


# Redis console
	# The server needs to be running...
	$ redis-cli
