When to test?


# When a test is especially short or simple compared to the application code it tests, lean toward writing the test first.
# When the desired behavior isnâ€™t yet crystal clear, lean toward writing the application code first, then write a test to codify the result.
# Because security is a top priority, err on the side of writing tests of the security model first.
# Whenever a bug is found, write a test to reproduce it and protect against regressions, then write the application code to fix it.
# Lean against writing tests for code (such as detailed HTML structure) likely to change in the future.
# Write tests before refactoring code, focusing on testing error-prone code thatâ€™s especially likely to break.

How to test: 

* we need to run our test suite to verify that the tests currently pass

$ rails db:migrate     # Necessary on some systems
$ rails test
=> 2 runs, 2 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors, 0 skips
