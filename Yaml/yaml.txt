// What is yaml - YAML - Yaml Ain't Markup Language

    <!-- Yaml is a data serialization language, which means application written 
         with a different technology can transfer data to each other using a common 
         agreed-on or a standard format -->

    # It is human readable and intuitive
    # file_name.yaml
    # YAML is superset of JSON: any valid JSON file is also valid YAML file 
    # Data Structures are defined through line separations and spaces with indentations (validation error with one single space and data structure wrong)

// YAML Syntax

# key-value pairs:

    app: user-authentication            # The string can be enclosed with quotes or not
    port: 9000                          
    version: 1.7


# Comments:
  <!-- Everything that starts with "#" yaml interprets as Comments -->

    # comment here
    app: user-authentication            
    port: 9000         
    # another comment here                 
    version: 1.7


# Objects:
  <!-- you can create an object in yaml by indenting the "key-value pairs" and enclosing it in an object -->

    microservice:
        app: user-authentication            
        port: 9000                          
        version: 1.7

    # Space needs to be exactly the same for each attribute of the object
    # Because YAML is so sensitive about spaces and indentations it is always a good idea to use YAML validator before you execute a configuration file


# Lists:
  <!-- By using "-" we create (or transform the object into) a list in YAML --> 

    microservice:                                              # List
        - app: user-authentication                          # Item of the list
          port: 9000                          
          version:                                           
          - 1.9                                             # List nesting list (You can align it with the parent or indent it)
          - 2.0
          - 2.1
        - app: shopping-cart                                # Item 2 of of the list
          port: 9002
          version: [1.9, 2.0, 2.1]                          # Lists can be nested with "[]", makes more readable

    // or

    micromicroservice:
        - user-authentication            
        - shopping-cart


# Booleans:

 microservice:
        - app: user-authentication            
          port: 9000                          
          version: 1.7
          deployed: true                      # YAML can also express boolean expression with "yes" or "no" // "on" or "off"


# Multiline Strings:
  <!-- The way i can do that is using the pipe symbol "|"

    multilineString: |
      this is a multiline string
      and this is the next line
      next line 
    
    //or

  <!-- In case you want a single long line, use ">" -->
    multilineString: >
      this is a single line string.
      that should be all on one line.
      some other stuff 


# Environment Variables:
  <!-- If there is a need of using a environmental variable defined, we can access it using a "$" --> 
  

  #readiness probe
  command:
   - /bin/sh
   - -ec 
   - >-
     mysql -h 127.0.0.1 -u root -p$MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD -e 'SELECT 1'


# Placeholders:
  <!-- Instead of directly writing the values, define placeholders "{{ .Values.service.example }} -->

    apiVersion:v1
    kind: Service 
    metadata:
        name: {{ .Values.service.name }}
    spec:
        selector:

            targetPort: {{ .Values.service.targetport }}


# Multiple YAML Documents:
  <!-- Inside of one YAML file we can define multiple components and separate them with "---"

    apiVersion:v1
    kind: Service

        name: {{ .Values.service.name }}
