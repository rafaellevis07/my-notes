======================================================================================== Explanation


TLS (Transport Layer Security) / SSL (Secure Socket Layer)
    <!-- are popular cryptographic protocols that are used to imbue web communications with integrity, security, 
         and resilience against unauthorized tampering. -->



======================================================================================== How does it work?


1. Browser requests a secure page (HTTPS) from the server
2. Server sends public key with SSL certificate (that is signed by the CA)
3. Browser checks the certificate signature from the server against the CA's public key 
3.1 Once checked, a green padlock appears in the top left corner of the browser
4. Browser creates symmetric keys, and encrypts it (using servers public key), and sends one of the symmetric keys to the server.
5. Server uses its private key to decrypt and get the browser's symmetric key 
6. Now all traffic between the browser and the server will be encrypted and decrypted with the same symmetric key 

Green padlock: It only indicates that the communication is encrypted, hackers can get SSL certificates for their websites as well
Symmetric key: shared keys, same two keys 
Asymmetric key: there are two keys, public key and private key. private key encrypts data, and public key decrypts data
    - It can work the other way around also.

Why SSL handshake?

Ssl was introduced for transport level security.. to protect data in transit.. 

There are 2 types : 1 way and 2 way. 

1 way is client verifies server .. 

2 way is both verify each other. This is done by exchanging public certs and matching them with the private key that is not shared
